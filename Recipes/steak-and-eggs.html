    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>If you just started one of those trendy, low-carb/high-protein diets, then your timing is excellent. I can't think of a better way to begin the day than this "Minute" Steak and Egg with Red Hot Butter Sauce — and that's true no matter what diet you're on. Having said that, I hope you're not on any special diet, and will simply enjoy this because it's so delicious and satisfying. Also, and much more importantly, you'll be able to have a slice of toast to mop up all the goodness.

        Besides being fast and easy, this is a relatively frugal way to, as my Dad liked to say, "see how the other half lives." I know, these days it's not really "the other half," but more like "the 1%." Nevertheless, steak and eggs sounds high-end, and it is, if you use filet mignon, but by using cheaper, tougher top-sirloin, and a few culinary tricks, we can enjoy the same breakfast without blowing up the budget.
        
        The keys are to pound your steak thin, and cook it quickly in a very hot pan. Exact times will depend on how thick your meat is, but about a minute to a minute and a half per side should get you a nice, juicy medium-rare. Once that's been accomplished, you just need a perfectly fried egg, drizzled with our red hot butter sauce, which only takes seconds to make. So, whether you serve this with toast or not, I really hope you give this a try soon. Enjoy!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul class="ingredients">
        <li>1 (6 ounce) top sirloin steak</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>4 teaspoons fine dry bread crumbs</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons clarified butter, melted</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon clarified butter, melted</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons butter, at room temperature</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Louisiana-style hot sauce</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons water (Optional)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sliced green onions</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ul class="directions">
        <li>Place steak between two pieces of plastic wrap and pound to a ¼-inch thickness. Season one side generously with salt and pepper, then sprinkle ½ of the bread crumbs over top. Place the plastic wrap back over the steak and pound a few times with the meat mallet. Repeat to season the other side with salt, pepper, and remaining bread crumbs.</li>
        <li>Set a pan over high heat. Add 2 tablespoons melted clarified butter and wait until it starts to smoke. Quickly and carefully add steak to the pan and cook for 1 minute. Flip steak and reduce heat to medium-high; cook until you see a little bit of pink juice pool on top of the steak, about 1 more minute. Flip again, turn off the heat, and transfer steak to a warm plate.</li>
        <li>Let the pan cool for 30 to 60 seconds, then add 1 teaspoon melted clarified butter. Turn heat to medium and add egg. Break the egg white so it's all the same thickness and the yolk is in the center. Add a pinch of salt and cook until egg white is cooked through with brown and crispy edges. Place the egg on top of the steak.</li>
        <li>Add room temperature butter and hot sauce to the warm pan. Swirl the pan until the butter has melted and emulsified into the hot sauce. Stir in water if sauce is too thick or starts to separate.</li>
        <li>Spoon sauce over steak and egg, and garnish with chives.</li>
    </ul>
